# Platforms spike

To figure out viable solutions for standardising the tech stack and approach for all of our docs sites.

We currently maintain the following:

1. [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org)
2. [Rafiki Docs](https://rafiki.dev)
3. [Payment Pointers](https://paymentpointers.org)
4. [OpenPayments API](https://docs.openpayments.guide/)
