# Platforms spike

To figure out viable solutions for standardising the tech stack and approach for all of our docs sites.

We currently maintain the following:

1. [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org)
2. [Rafiki Docs](https://rafiki.dev)
3. [Payment Pointers](https://paymentpointers.org)
4. [OpenPayments API](https://docs.openpayments.guide/)
5. [Interledger](https://interledger.org/developer-tools/get-started/overview/)

This repo contains the code for all the demo docs sites built with Nextra, Starlight or Astro. Those which have successfully become actual sites have been moved out to their own repositories and are live in production. The code remaining in this repository is for reference and testing only.
