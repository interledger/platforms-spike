# Overview

## What is Rafiki?

Rafiki is open source software that allows an [Account Servicing Entity](../reference/glossary.md#account-servicing-entity) to enable [Interledger](../reference/glossary.md#interledger-protocol) functionality on its users' accounts.

This includes

- sending and receiving payments (via [SPSP](../reference/glossary.md#simple-payments-setup-protocol-spsp) and [Open Payments](../reference/glossary.md#open-payments))
- allowing third-party access to initiate payments and view transation data (via [Open Payments](../reference/glossary.md#open-payments))

**‚ùó Rafiki is intended to be run by [Account Servicing Entities](../reference/glossary.md#account-servicing-entity) only and should not be used in production by non-regulated entities.**

Rafiki is made up of several components including an Interledger connector, a high-throughput accounting database called [TigerBeetle](../reference/glossary.md#tigerbeetle), and several APIs:

- the [Admin API](../integration/management.md) to create [peering relationships](../reference/glossary.md#peer), add supported [assets](../reference/glossary.md#asset), and issue [payment pointers](../reference/glossary.md#payment-pointer)
- the [Open Payments](../reference/glossary.md#open-payments) API to allow third-parties (with the account holder's consent) to initiate payments and to view the transaction history
- the [SPSP](../reference/glossary.md#simple-payments-setup-protocol-spsp) API for simple Interledger Payments

Additionally, this package also includes a reference implementation of a [GNAP](../reference/glossary.md#grant-negotiation-authorization-protocol) authorization server which handles the access control for the [Open Payments](../reference/glossary.md#open-payments) API. For more information on the architecture, check out the [Architecture documentation](./architecture.md).
