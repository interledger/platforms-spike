# Accounts and Transfers

## Accounts

Rafiki uses a combination of liquidity and settlement accounts to perform double-entry accounting.

### Liquidity account

A liquidity account may only hold a positive balance. Rafiki enforces that its total debits MUST NOT exceed its total credits amount.

There is one liquidity account for each of the following resource:

- Asset
- Peer
- Payment Pointer (for [SPSP](../../reference/glossary#spsp) / [Web Monetization](../../reference/glossary#web-monetization) receiving)
- Incoming Payment
- Outgoing Payment

### Settlement account

A settlement account may only hold a negative balance. Rafiki enforces that its total credits MUST NOT exceed its total debits amount. A settlement account represents those total amount of funds an [Account Servicing Entity](./glossary/a ccount-servicing-entity) has deposited into Rafiki.

There is one settlement account for each asset.

## Transfers

Rafiki transfers perform double-entry accounting. Every transfer increases both the total debits of one account and the total credits of a second account by the same amount.
